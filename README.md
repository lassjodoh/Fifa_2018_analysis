# FIFA Player Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of FIFA's player data, which includes personal details, wages, physical attributes, technical skills, potential, and positional strengths. The dataset used in this project represents preliminary data from FIFA 2018. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the world of football and the decision-making process of a football manager.

##### Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a preliminary data analysis, exploring the dataset and extracting basic observations using data analytical tools of your choice. The following tasks are expected to be accomplished:
•	Come up with players' profiles, highlighting the characteristics of players from different teams/countries.
•	Generate insights and recommendations to assist the coach in understanding the competition better.

##### Analysis Questions
In this project, the analysis will be focused on answering the following questions:
1.	Prepare a rank-ordered list of the top 10 countries with the most players. Additionally, list the top 5 countries that produce the highest number of footballers playing at this level.
2.	Interpret the age at which a player typically stops improving.
3.	Which type of offensive player tends to receive the highest pay: the striker, the right-winger, or the left-winger? Visualize the data using a scatter plot for all three positions.
4.	Identify the top 5 players for each preferred position based on overall and potential points. Determine the best player in 2018.
5.	Determine which club(s) have the highest share of players from England, Spain, and Germany, respectively.
6.	As the National coach of the France team, compare the national teams of England, Spain, Italy, and Germany to gain insights into the competition. The team formation is restricted to 4-3-3 (4 defenders, 3 midfielders, 3 forwards, 1 Goal Keeper), and players with an overall value above 75 are preferred. Form the best team for each of the mentioned countries and document the insights to be shared with the coach.

##### Tools and Technologies
To carry out the analysis, the following tools and technologies were utilized:
•	Python: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
•	Jupyter Notebook: Integrated development environment (IDE) for interactive data exploration and analysis.
•	Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
•	NumPy: Python library for numerical computing.
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization.
•	Scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning models and algorithms.

##### Usage and Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis or use the provided code and data, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2.	Install the necessary dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the Fifa.xlsx file.
3.	Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook on a compatible IDE.
4.	Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.
5.	Modify the code or experiment with different approaches to further enhance the analysis.

##### Limitations
It's important to consider the following limitations of the analysis:
•	The analysis is based on historical data from the 2018 FIFA tournament, and its applicability to future events may vary.
•	The accuracy and reliability of the analysis depend on the quality and completeness of the dataset.
•	The analysis may not capture all possible factors.
